## Vertex Buffer Objects

Vertex buffers Objects or VBOs for short are like containers, which can contain information about vertices that we want to send to OpenGL's rendering pipeline. The name can be a little misleading, as when we talk about a "vertex" in mathematics, we usually just mean a single **point** having an x, y and z (in 3D space), but in OpenGL a vertex can have a lot more information than just a specific coordinate.
